-----------------------


Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier. With Truffle, you get:

* Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.
* Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai.
* Configurable build pipeline with support for custom build processes.
* Scriptable deployment & migrations framework.
* Network management for deploying to many public & private networks.
* Interactive console for direct contract communication.
* Instant rebuilding of assets during development.
* External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.

### Install

```
$ npm install -g truffle
```

### Quick Usage

For a default set of contracts and tests, run the following within an empty project directory:

```
$ truffle init
```

From there, you can run `truffle compile`, `truffle migrate` and `truffle test` to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests.

Be sure you're connected to an ethereum client before running these commands. If you're new, install [testrpc](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) to run a local blockchain RPC server. After that, simply run `testrpc` in a new tab.

See [the documentation](http://truffleframework.com/docs/) for more details.
